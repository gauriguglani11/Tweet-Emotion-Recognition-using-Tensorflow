# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-using-Tensorflow
Depicting the emotions through tweets using Tensorflow.
Tweet Emotion Recognition with TensorFlow
Tasks to be performed:
1.	Task 1: Introduction
2.	Task 2: Setup and Imports
3.	Task 3: Importing Data
4.	Task 4: Tokenizer
5.	Task 5: Padding and Truncating Sequences
6.	Task 6: Preparing Labels
7.	Task 7: Creating the Model
8.	Task 8: Training the Model
9.	Task 9: Evaluating the Model

a.	we will learn to use TensorFlow to create and train a Recurrent Neural Network which will be able to classify emotions in Tweets. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project.
b.	Recurrent neural Networks are type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data.
c.	Sequential data refers to any data in proper sequence. Example dna sequences which is biomedical informatics, Time series, Text mining, sentiment analysis, Recurrent neural network etc
d.	Time series data also referred as time- stamped data which is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Time series data is data collected at different points in time. These data points typically consist of successive measurements made from the same source over a time interval and are used to track change over time.
e.	Like feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks utilize training data to learn.
f.	They are distinguished by their “memory” as they take information from prior inputs to influence the current input and output. While traditional deep neural networks assume that inputs and outputs are independent of each other, the output of recurrent neural networks depend on the prior elements within the sequence. 
g.	In Natural Language Processing, RNNs are frequently used (NLP). Because RNNs have internal memory, they are especially useful for machine learning applications that need sequential input. Time series data can also be forecasted using RNNs.
h.	Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. It’s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.
i.	sentiment analysis focuses on the polarity of a text (positive, negative, neutral) but it also goes beyond polarity to detect specific feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc), urgency (urgent, not urgent) and even intentions (interested v. not interested).
j.	Hugging Face is a community and data science platform that provides: Tools that enable users to build, train and deploy ML models based on open source (OS) code and technologies.
k.	A corpus is a large and structured set of machine-readable texts that have been produced in a natural communicative setting. Its plural is corpora. They can be derived in different ways like text that was originally electronic, transcripts of spoken language and optical character recognition, etc.
